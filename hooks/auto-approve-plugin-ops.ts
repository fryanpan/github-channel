/**
 * PreToolUse hook for the github-claude-channel plugin.
 *
 * Auto-approves tool calls that fall inside the plugin's own surface so
 * users don't have to "Allow Claude to use <tool>" for every new MCP tool
 * the plugin ships.
 *
 * Two categories, evaluated independently:
 *
 *   1. **MCP tools published by this plugin**
 *      Tool name matches `mcp__plugin_github-claude-channel_github-claude-channel__*` → approve.
 *      Rationale: the user opted into the entire MCP surface when they ran
 *      `claude plugin install github-claude-channel@…`. Making them re-opt-in
 *      per tool is friction without security value — the MCP server is the
 *      trust boundary, not the individual tool names. Auto-approving here
 *      means new tools shipped in plugin updates don't require every user
 *      to re-edit `~/.claude/settings.json`.
 *
 *   2. **Bash patterns specific to the plugin's lifecycle**
 *      Narrow allowlist of dev-mode commands the plugin documents in the
 *      README:
 *        - `bun broker.ts` (foreground broker daemon)
 *        - `bun server.ts` (foreground MCP server)
 *      Anything else falls through to Claude Code's normal prompt.
 *
 * Everything outside the plugin's domain (file writes outside the project,
 * destructive ops, third-party MCP tools, etc.) is unaffected.
 *
 * On any error (malformed payload, unexpected shape) the hook exits 0
 * with no decision so Claude Code's normal prompt fires — fail-open is
 * safer than fail-block here.
 *
 * Reference design: https://github.com/fryanpan/claude-live-feedback-plugin/pull/40
